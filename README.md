# ❤️ Heart Attack Analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of a **heart disease dataset with 303 patient records**.  
The goal was to uncover **patterns, distributions, and key health indicators** that contribute to heart attack risk.  

The analysis identifies demographic trends, lifestyle factors, and medical attributes that influence cardiovascular health.  
Visualizations are used to present findings in an interpretable manner for healthcare research and predictive modeling.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **54.5% of patients** were identified with a **positive heart attack risk** (output = 1).  
- **69% of patients were male**, showing higher vulnerability among men.  
- Majority of cases were in the **40–55 age group**, indicating early onset risk.  
- **47% of patients** showed **exercise-induced angina**, a strong predictor of heart attack.  
- Cholesterol and resting blood pressure exhibited **clear skewness and outliers** that highlight potential clinical risks.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Pie charts** → Heart attack risk distribution  
- **Bar plots** → Gender vs. risk, age groups vs. risk  
- **Boxplots** → Cholesterol & blood pressure variations  
- **Histograms** → Age, cholesterol, resting BP distributions
